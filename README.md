# Php-encryption-decryption-form
course assignment submission for CIS5610 
Create a single PHP file (All In One Form) that encrypts a string into a numeric representation or decrypts a numeric representation into a string. This is a symmetric encryption, i.e., decryption is the reverse of encryption using the same key.

The form should include a textbox, two radio buttons and a submit button. Use the radio buttons to

indicate whether the string in the texbox is to be encrypted or decrypted.
